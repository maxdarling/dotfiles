;; goal: get this: http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/emacs_theme_gallery.html
;; todo: more keyword highlighting (blue, gold, etc)
;; this is from xah elisp mode ($32) http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/xah-elisp-mode.html
;; I should just try to reverse-eng the colorscheme. a fun little starter project.

;; (setq myvar)

;; (defvar myvar 2 "ceinahitce")
;; (defun mark-sexp (&optional arg allow-extend)
;;   (interactive "ur mom")
;;   (let ((hello 5))
;;     (eq hello 1)))

;; so, the var color is actually same as xah. but only a defvar is considered a
;; variable, unlike the setqs or lets.
;; note: C-u C-x = will show info about the char under cursor, including what
;; font face it belongs to. the black words are not part of a font-face, that's
;; the issue. So Xah has defined his own mappings for font-faces.
