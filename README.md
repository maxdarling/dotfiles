## Todo
- add neovim, vim bootstrap steps
- add git folder (and move `~/.personal_github_token` there, but not tracked)

## Setup
Bootstrap with `zsh bootstrap.zsh`

## Keyboard
- Keyboard: [Glove 80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) keyboard
- Layout: ["Engram"](https://engram.dev/) (the best to my knowledge)
- [My Glove80 layout](https://my.glove80.com/#/layout/user/8c6c5fdf-f14b-40e7-bed5-a3e2bb39f60a)
- Fn key mappings via Hammerspoon

## System
- chrome last tab mapped to cmd+E (via ["recent tabs"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recent-tabs/ocllfmhjhfmogablefmibmjcodggknml?hl=en))

- macOS key repeat speed maxed (jarring at first, but super good)

- macOS pointer acceleration disabled

-  I use emacs-style (precisely, [readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html)) keys (terminal, chrome, etc)
    - alt+arrow, alt+backspace for word-level nav and delete
    - ctrl-a and ctrl-e for jumping to start/end of line
    - ctrl-k to delete right of cursor
   
- [firenvim](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim) to pop into neovim for text area editing in Chromee using ctrl-x. Handy for editing files on github, like this very one!

- dotfile inspo:
