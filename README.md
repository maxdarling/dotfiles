## Instructions
Run `zsh bootstrap.zsh`. macOS only.

## Keyboard
- Keyboard: [Glove 80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) keyboard
- Layout: ["Engram"](https://engram.dev/) (the best to my knowledge)
- [My glove80 engram layout and custom mappings](https://my.glove80.com/#/layout/user/8c6c5fdf-f14b-40e7-bed5-a3e2bb39f60a)
- Fn keys map to commonly used apps via [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) (à la [Xah Lee](http://xahlee.info/kbd/set_single_key_to_switch_app.html))

## Browser
- chrome last tab mapped to ⌘E (via ["recent tabs"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recent-tabs/ocllfmhjhfmogablefmibmjcodggknml?hl=en))
- [Vimium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en&pli=1) chrome extension for keyboard-driven browser navigation. I still use the mouse! But variation is key. Most important: scroll with single key press and hold ('j' and 'k' or 'u' and 'd') instead of mouse wheel scrolling, which is a big cause of RSI!

## System
- macOS "key repeat rate" maxed, "delay until repeat" minned (takes a week to get used to. so good.)
- macOS pointer acceleration disabled
-  I use emacs-style (precisely, [readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html)) keys in terminal, chrome, etc
    - alt+arrow, alt+backspace for word-level nav and delete
    - ctrl-a and ctrl-e for jumping to start/end of line
    - ctrl-k to delete right of cursor
	- hold shift to make selection

## Misc
- dotfile inspo:
    - [MIT "missing semester"](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/command-line/#dotfiles)
